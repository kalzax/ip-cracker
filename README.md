# ip-cracker!

I would like to clarify that I am in no way responsible if you use this script for illegal purposes.

This script allows you to search for  vulnerabilities "ENV" &  "/.svn/entries" and "/.hg/dirstate"
these are lavarel faults, have been there for several years 
The biggest sites to which I have had access to the database or access to their SMTP (whether AWS sendgrid mailgun...)
are boldcup.eu lastminute.com jetcost.com 
depending on the success of this script, a v2 with more than 30 additional lavarel flaws will be put online
